# RESTful API from OMDb

This application executes a REST API that, given a movie or series title, returns the results available in the OMDb API, which is a RESTful web service to obtain that information.

To execute the code, it is necessary to run the **main.py** file in a compatible IDE (Pycharm, for example).

Before running the code, make sure you have executed the following command:

`pipenv install`

That will install all the necessary packages to run the code without problems.
